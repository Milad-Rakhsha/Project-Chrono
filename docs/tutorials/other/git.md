The full Chrono::Engine project, including source code, is hosted in the
Git repository

**`    https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono.git   `**

This technology allows everyone to get the latest version from the
server.

The Git technology is described in general at <http://git-scm.com> , we
invite you to read the basic principles of Git on these and other web
pages.

There are many methods to use Git:

-   by command-line
-   by browsing the web interface at
    [1](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono.git)
-   or via a graphical client.

Here are some suggestions.

Download a Git client
---------------------

There are many clients that can be installed on your PC for using SVN:
one of the most user-friendly tools, with user interface, is

-   [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (for Windows,
    Linux, etc.)

Clone the Git Repository
------------------------

In most Git clients there is a window or a menu to perform the **Git
cloning** of the Git repository, that is you create a local copy on your
hard disk of the remote repository. Cloning must be done only once.

Update, Commit, Pull, Push, ...
-------------------------------

The usual pattern, on a periodic base, for developers, is the following:

1.  modify your files
2.  stage and commit the modifications to your local repo
3.  pull modifications from the remote repo, ex. changes made by other
    developers, and merge into your repo
4.  push your modifications to the remote repo, *if you have credentials
    to do so*.

etc.

If you want to join the Chrono::Engine developer team and become a
developer that actively contributes in expanding the Chrono::Engine
features, you can contact us. In most cases, a *pull request* will be
sufficient to handle modifications to the project.
