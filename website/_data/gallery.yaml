      url: 'FXKg1KFTKc0'
      description: 'Simulation of a CES Corona Electrostatic Separator. This is part of a device for waste processing (it separates plastic particles from metal particles using high-potential electric fields). Particles are created from statistical distributions of size, density, shape, etc. The Chrono::Engine simulation is rendered with POVray.'

    - title: Escapement
      url: 'h-Yri_n9fRI'
      description: 'Simulation of a `Swiss lever escapement`. Constraints, shapes and collision surfaces have been created using SolidWorks. The Chrono::Engine SolidWorks Add-In tool has been used to export the model to a python file. The model has been imported by a C++ program for the simulation; this is a recording of a real-time visualization, using the Irrlicht unit.'

      url: 'CVpHUlBJfho'
      description: 'Granular flow test: simulation of an hopper filled with 50,000 spheres. Note that the container is not 2D, because its width is 5d (where d is the diameter of the spheres). The simulation has been computed using the Chrono::Engine library for mechanical simulations, and it has been rendered with POV-ray.'

    - title: Real-time conveyor
      url: 'WkgbBvGl5JU'
      description: 'Test: real-time simulation of a conveyor belt. This is a screen recording of the interface of a small program based on the C++ Chrono::Engine physics library. The purpose is to test a new C++ class for simulating conveyor belts, that I recently implemented in Chrono::Engine. Debris is continuosly created by instancing rigid bodies with various shapes. The conveyor belt is invisible, only two fences are drawn. In this simple executable, the user can interact with two sliders in the graphical user interface in order to see the effect of belt speed and flow (particles/second).'
