<h3>What is {% include module.html first="PROJECT" second="CHRONO" %}?</h3>

{% include module.html first="PROJECT" second="CHRONO" %} is a physics-based modelling and simulation infrastructure based on a platform-independent, open-source design. 
The core of {% include module.html first="PROJECT" second="CHRONO" %} is the Chrono::Engine middleware, an object-oriented library whose C++ API can be used to develop simulation software. 
Among the other components of the {% include module.html first="PROJECT" second="CHRONO" %} ecosystems are: 

- Chrono::Parallel, a library for enabling parallel computation in Chrono
- Chrono::Vehicle, which provides support for vehicle dynamics simulation
- Chrono::FEA, which provides support for linear and nonlinear Finite Element Analysis
- Chrono::FSI, which provides support for Fluid-Solid Interaction problems
- Chrono::PyEngine, which enables one to use Chrono::Engine in Python
- Chrono::SolidWorks, an add-in for SolidWorks&copy;, which can be used to export 3D models and geometries from a  CAD file into Chrono

### HISTORY

The first version of the Chrono::Engine was developed in 1998 by [Prof. Alessandro Tasora](http://dynamics.eng.unipr.it/tasora) when he was a student at the Politecnico di Milano. It was the result of a thesis in Mechanical Engineering. Originally, Chrono::Engine was meant to be a multibody simulation tool for robotics and biomechanics applications.


Until 2002, Chrono::Engine was tightly linked to the Realsoft3D modeller. In 2002-2005 the software was gradually reorganized in the form of a standalone library, just like it is today. Alessandro started working in 2005 with [Professor Mihai Anitescu](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~anitescu/) from University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratories. Their work strengthened the handling of large frictional contact models in Chrono. 

[Professor Dan Negrut](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~negrut/index.htm) joined the Project Chrono effort in 2007. The members of Simulation-Based Engineering Lab [\(SBEL\)](http://sbel.wisc.edu) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have been active in its development ever since. 

We took the decision to release Chrono as open source in 2013, when we started to use the name {% include module.html first="PROJECT" second="CHRONO" %} to recognize the fact that this software infrastructure had become a multi-physics simulation engine. Chrono's biggest break came in 2014, when the US Army decided to invest US $1.8 million in its development as an open source platform for physics-based modelling and simulation. Chrono development is going strong with the next release planned for August 15, 2016.
