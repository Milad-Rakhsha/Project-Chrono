### Collaboration opportunities
   

- If you are in academia:
  - Let us help you with using Chrono in your research projects
  - Work with us by making Chrono part of your proposal. We'd be very happy to provide a collaboration letter
  - Join us at a training course in US (University of Wisconsin-Madison) or Europe (University of Parma, Italy). Next opportunity: December 2016, Madison, Wisconsin.

- If you are in industry, we can:
  - Assist you with understanding what Chrono can do. This amounts to software support
  - Assist you with developing new Chrono features that you would be using exclusively in-house. Most of these projects are process integration and automation
  - Assist you with straight consulting; i.e., projects where you don't want to learn/use the code, but you are interested in using the software to answer a technical question you have to deal with
  - Assist you with interfacing Chrono with other third party CAD/CAE tools such as MATLAB&copy;, Simulink&copy;, SolidWorks&copy;, etc.
  - Run one to three days long Chrono tutorials at your organization
