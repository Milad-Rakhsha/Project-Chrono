#### If you are in academia:
- Work with us by making Chrono part of your proposal
- We organize training courses in US (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Europe (Italy)
  
------------------------------
  
  
#### If you are in industry, we can:
- Assist you with understanding what Chrono can do. This amounts to software support
- Assist you with developing new Chrono features that you would be using exclusively in-house. Most of these projects are process integration and automation
- Assist you with straight consulting; i.e., projects where you don't want to learn/use the code, but you are interested in using the software to answer a technical question you have to deal with
- Assist you with interfacing Chrono with other third party CAD/CAE tools such as MATLAB&copy;, Simulink&copy;, SolidWorks&copy;, etc.
- Run one to three days long Chrono tutorials at your organization
  
  
These consulting activities fund for the most part future developments of Chrono.
