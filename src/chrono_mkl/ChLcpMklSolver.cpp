	/** \brief It calls Intel MKL Pardiso Sparse Direct Solver.
	*
	*	On the first call the routine resets the matrix and vectors involved to the size of the current problem.
	*	Every time the system stored in \c sysd is converted in a CSR3 standard matrix that will be later used by Pardiso.
	*	If the sparsity pattern lock is turned on then the matrix will try, as long as possible, to preserve not only the arrays dimensions,
	*	but it also keeps column and row indexes through different calls.
