Collision example (demo_collision.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_collision}
==========================

An introductory tutorial about collisions.

A bunch of random shapes will fall into a box, 
stacking in random order, while a mixer blade rotates.

Learn about:

- how to enable collisions

- how to change the settings of the stepper in 
  sake of higher precision or higher computing speed.
  
- create a motor between two parts.
