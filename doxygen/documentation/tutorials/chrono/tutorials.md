==========================

The following links describe a set of basic Chrono tutorials. 

-   @subpage demo_buildsystem
	
    Tutorial which teaches the basic approach to build and simulate mechanical systems. No 3D user interface is used here, so you compile this example even if you do not have Irrlicht 3D visualization library installed. Learn how:

    - create a physical system (a slider-crank)
    - add/remove rigid bodies
    - create mechanical joints between bodies
    - perform a simulation 
    - No GUI: only text output.
