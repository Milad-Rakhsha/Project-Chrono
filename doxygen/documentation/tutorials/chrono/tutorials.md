Chrono core tutorials      {#tutorial_table_of_content_chrono}
==========================

The following links describe a set of basic Chrono tutorials. 

These tutorials teach how to setup physical systems in Chrono::Engine. 
Here we do not use any graphical user interface: see 
the [Irrlicht tutorials](@ref tutorial_table_of_content_chrono_irrlicht) 
for demos with a 3D graphical output. 

-   @subpage tutorial_demo_buildsystem
	
    Tutorial which teaches the basic approach to build and simulate mechanical systems. No 3D user interface is used here, so you compile this example even if you do not have Irrlicht 3D visualization library installed. Learn how:

    - create a physical system (a slider-crank)
    - add/remove rigid bodies
    - create mechanical joints between bodies
    - perform a simulation 
    - No GUI: only text output. 

-   @subpage tutorial_demo_powertrain

    Tutorial which teaches the basic approach to build systems that embed powertrains, made with 1-degree-of-freedom items (rotating shafts).

    - connect 1D shafts with transmission ratios
    - connect 1D shafts with 1D clutches, brakes, etc.
    - connect a 1D shaft to a 3D body. 
    - No GUI: only text output. 

-   @subpage tutorial_demo_chfunctions

    Tutorial that teaches how to use the ChFunction inherited classes to build math functions of y=f(x) type. The ChFunction objects are 'building blocks' whose main usage is to describe motion laws, such as trajectories in automation and robotics, etc.

    - create and use ChFunction objects, from available classes.
    - define a custom function by inheriting from ChFunction class. 
    - No GUI: only text output. 

-   @subpage tutorial_demo_math

    Tutorial that teaches main mathematical tools (vectors, matrices)
	
-   @subpage tutorial_demo_coords

    Tutorial that teaches coordinate transformations
	
-   @subpage tutorial_demo_stream

    Tutorial that teaches how to use ChStream classes to write/load from file streams.

-   @subpage tutorial_demo_archive

    Tutorial that teaches how to perform serialization/deserialization of C++ classes
